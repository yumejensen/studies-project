/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * 0: Intro
 * Variables are names which point to data in JavaScript. They can also be thought of as "containers" that hold data. 
 * Variables can hold many data types, such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, and functions. 
 * The variable naming convention in JavaScript is called camelCase, where the first word is lowercase 
 * and each following word has an uppercased first letter.
 * 
 * 
 * 1: Declaration and Assignment
 * Variables are declared with the keywords var, let, and const.
 * Simply declaring a variable would be a keyword followed by the variable name.
 * Assigning a variable to a value uses the assignment operator =.
 * var myName;
 * myName = "Yume";
 * 
 * Variables can be declared and assigned in the same line. This is called initialization.
 * var myAge = 25;
 * let classData = {name: "Alex Aaron", occupation: "Instructor"}
 * const addTen = (num) => num + 10;
 * 
 * There is also a method of declaring variables called "destructuring"
 *
